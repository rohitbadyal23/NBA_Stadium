The home page is the NBA.php, in this page 
you can see a list of all the NBA team. If you click 
the links from the Team column, you will be redirected 
to the Stadiums.php. In this page you can see
all the stadium info about that certain team and a google map
location of the stadium. If you click the Players link in the 
Players Column you will be redirected to Players.php.
In this page you can see all the active players playing for that 
certain team. Theres an error if you try to click on 
Toronto Raptors stadium, I think it has to do with its stadium id but did
not know how to fix it.
